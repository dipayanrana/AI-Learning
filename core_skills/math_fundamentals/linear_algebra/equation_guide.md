# Solving Linear Equations: 2x + 3 = 7

Linear equations are fundamental in algebra and appear frequently in various mathematical contexts. Below is a plain text explanation of how to solve the equation **2x + 3 = 7**.

## Steps to Solve

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**
   - Start with the equation: **2x + 3 = 7**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: **2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3**
   - This simplifies to: **2x = 4**

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**
   - Divide both sides by 2: **2x / 2 = 4 / 2**
   - This simplifies to: **x = 2**

## Conclusion

The solution to the equation **2x + 3 = 7** is **x = 2**.

## Key Concepts

- **Balance:** Any operation performed on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to maintain equality.
- **Isolation:** The goal is to isolate the variable **x** on one side of the equation to determine its value.
