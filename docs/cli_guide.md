# Document Your Learnings

## Overview
Today, I set up my development environment and repository, wrote my first Python scripts, and reinforced foundational math skills by solving the linear equation 2x + 3 = 7.

## Environment and Repository Setup
- **Python Installation:** Installed Python 3.8+ and verified it via the terminal.
- **Repository Initialization:** Organized the project in a structured directory and initialized Git with the first commit.

## Python Basics
- **Hello, World!:** Created and ran `hello.py` to display a simple greeting.
- **Variables & Arithmetic:** Developed `variables_practice.py` to experiment with assignments and arithmetic operations.
- **Control Structures:** Explored loops and functions to understand basic Python constructs.

## Math Fundamentals
- **Linear Equation (2x + 3 = 7):**
  - **Step 1:** Subtracted 3 from both sides to isolate the term with x (yielding 2x = 4).
  - **Step 2:** Divided both sides by 2 to solve for x (resulting in x = 2).
- **Python Implementation:** Wrote a function (`solve_linear`) in `equation_solver.py` to automate the solving process, including error handling for division by zero.

## Reflections and Next Steps
- **Key Learnings:**
  - The importance of a well-organized development environment.
  - Fundamental Python programming techniques and basic mathematical problem-solving.
  - The value of thorough documentation for tracking progress and facilitating future collaboration.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Expand the CLI calculator with additional features.
  - Further modularize code to improve testing and maintenance
